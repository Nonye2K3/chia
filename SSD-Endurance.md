estimated GiB per minute based off class of drives for drives that have yet to be tested, for the drives in the wiki I have added the measured numbers.

## Math
* NAND P/E Cycles = amount of program / erase cycles NAND can do before wearing out. NAND programs (writes) in pages and erases in blocks (contains many pages)
* Wearing out - SSD no longer meeting UBER (uncorrectable bit error rate),  retention (keeping data safe while powered off), failure rate, or user capacity
* UBER = number of data errors / number of bits read
* WAF (Write Amplification Factor) = NAND writes / host writes
* TBW or PBW â€“ amount of host writes to SSD before wearing out
* TBW = drive capacity * cycles / WAF
* DWPD (drive writes per day): amount of data you can write to device each day of the warranty (typically 5 years) without wearing out
* DWPD = TBW/365/5/drive capacity

## Monitor Endurance in Linux


### NVMe
https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli

https://nvmexpress.org/open-source-nvme-management-utility-nvme-command-line-interface-nvme-cli/

Reading endurance with NVMe-CLI - this is the gas gauge that shows total endurance used 

`sudo nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0 | grep percentage_used`
	
Reading amount of writes that the drive have actually done

`sudo nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0 | grep data_units_written`
	
Bytes written = output * 1000 * 512B

TBW = output * 1000 * 512B / (1000^4) or (1024^4)

To find out NAND writes, you will have use the vendor plugins for NVMe-CLI.

`sudo nvme <vendor name> help`

Example with an Intel SSD

`sudo nvme intel smart-log-add /dev/nvme0`


### SATA
In SATA you can use the following commands

`sudo apt install smartmontools`

`sudo smartctl -x /dev/sda | grep Logical`

`sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda`

looking for Media_Wearout_Indicator

note this does also work for NVMe for basic SMART health info

`sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme0`

### SAS
`sg_logs /dev/sg1 --page=0x11`

look for

```Percentage used endurance indicator: 0%```
