estimated GiB per minute based off class of drives for drives that have yet to be tested, for the drives in the wiki I have added the measured numbers.

## Math
* NAND P/E Cycles = amount of program / erase cycles NAND can do before wearing out. NAND programs (writes) in pages and erases in blocks (contains many pages)
* Wearing out - SSD no longer meeting UBER (uncorrectable bit error rate),  retention (keeping data safe while powered off), failure rate, or user capacity
* UBER = number of data errors / number of bits read
* WAF (Write Amplification Factor) = NAND writes / host writes
* TBW or PBW â€“ amount of host writes to SSD before wearing out
* TBW = drive capacity * cycles / WAF
* DWPD (drive writes per day): amount of data you can write to device each day of the warranty (typically 5 years) without wearing out
* DWPD = TBW/365/5/drive capacity

## Monitor Endurance in Linux

Reading endurance with NVMe-CLI - this is the gas gauge that shows total endurance used 

`sudo nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0 | grep percentage_used`
	
Reading amount of writes that the drive have actually done

`sudo nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0 | grep data_units_written`
	
Bytes written = output * 1000 * 512B
TBW = output * 1000 * 512B / (1000^4) or (1024^4)
