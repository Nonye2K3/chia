Of the computers that may have sync issues-- here is 1 solution to check

Port 8444 is the port where other Chia computers can communicate into your pc, so that Chia can quickly talk to another PC and link up and start to download and sync with Chia blockchian and have the user's pc sync up.

The network is under a heavy rapid growth / expansion. And many of the newly arrived Chia peers (computers) do not open up port 8444. It makes it very hard for the network. 

Please use the link below to check if your router port 8444 is closed and recommend to open it.

All peers with a closed port 8444 is completely depending on peers with open port 8444. It's the only ones they can talk to. If you got 1000 nodes with an open port 8444, but 20,000 nodes with a closed port 8444, it will only just be able to theoretically have enough IP's so every one can get what they want. Right now (Mid April '20) it seems that number is even much worse. And it causes a scenario where there just isn't enough open port 8444 peers to serve all the closed port 8444 peers. The only way around this, is to ensure that you got an open port 8444.

If you somehow are able to open up your port 8444, within a minute, you will have peers connecting to you, atleast, you should have a much easier time to get connections established. 

On the subject of how to port forward, all I'm going to say, its different from router brand to brand, even from model to model.
Google.com presents 60+ million hits on "[Port forwarding](https://www.google.com/search?q=port+forwarding&source=hp&ei=HDB-YILlDoOB9u8P-72_4AM&iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAYH4-LJZmDqT9olTepGniZToDYoAz5s4Q&oq=port+for&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMYADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6CAgAELEDEIMBOgUIABCxAzoICC4QsQMQgwE6CwgAELEDEMcBEKMCOgUILhCxAzoICAAQxwEQrwE6CAguELEDEJMCOgIILjoECAAQCjoGCAAQChATOggIABAKEB4QEzoGCAAQHhATUMMPWLghYJgqaANwAHgAgAFeiAGlBZIBAjEwmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdperABAA&sclient=gws-wiz)"

If you want to test if your port is really open, one site that offers that is this:
https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
It should auto find your IP, so just plot in 8444, and hit the button.

Note: The Chia software does what it can to open port 8444 automatically for you. But the UPnP protocol is a hit and miss kind of thing, some dont have a good implementation of it, others simply dont have it enabled by default. Please test for open port 8444!

A regular pc can communicate **out** with endless ports-- if user is sending a signal out-- pc opens a port- signal goes out, pc closes the port.  If the users port 8444 is closed, the users pc has to start sending multiple signals out and hope that a pc with open port 8444 will link with them, then the sync starts. (1) pc can only link up a few pc and with so many other chia users coming on board, they all have to wait.  Keep in mind, Chia is built on a mesh network, the blockchain is shared among all the users, not from central pc.
