# Understanding Chialisp

Documentation is very new and some components are still rapidly changing, but this is a consolidated place to learn about Chialisp and clvm.

## Introductory material

- Bram’s introductory post on [Chialisp](https://www.chia.net/2019/11/27/chialisp.en.html)
- Bram’s introduction to our [MVP of Coloured coins](https://www.chia.net/2020/04/29/coloured-coins-launch.en.html)

## Coloured coins

The first Chialisp smart transaction that we integrated into chia-blockchain were Coloured Coins. We will be integrating additional smart transactions and wallets into chia-blockchain in most releases.
